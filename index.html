                <p>That’s certainly been the mantra for Miami based cruise line Royal Caribbean, who just announced their largest ship Icon of the Seas will officially enter service in 2024. At maximum capacity, Icon will be capable of hosting 7,600 passengers on its inaugural sail on January 28, 2024.</p>
                <p>“With each new ship, we raise the bar in the travel industry while enhancing what our guests know and love,” President and CEO, Royal Caribbean Group Jason Liberty said in a statement today. “From the moment they step on board, every experience is specifically designed to give them the best vacation anywhere on land and at sea. With Icon of the Seas, we’ve taken this to a new level and made the ultimate family vacation.”</p>
